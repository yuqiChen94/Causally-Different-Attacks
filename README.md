# Finding Causally Different Cyber-Physical System Attacks

## Usage


We provide two examples here. 

Run "generate_causal_capability_sets.py" to generate attacks to overflow sensor LIT101.
Run "approximating_the_causal_capabilities.py" to pruned a successful attack. (See Algorithm 3).

Noted that after generating the attacks, these attacks should be evaluated in the real system. The scripts used to inject attacks are in the folder "attack_array".
